## Best Practices

### Trend Analysis Strategy
1. **Multi-Metric Analysis** - Analyze multiple correlated metrics together
2. **Seasonal Adjustment** - Account for known seasonal patterns
3. **Confidence Intervals** - Always provide uncertainty ranges for forecasts
4. **Regular Updates** - Refresh models with new data regularly
5. **Anomaly Integration** - Use anomalies to improve trend models

### Forecasting Accuracy
- Use ensemble methods for better accuracy
- Validate forecasts against actual outcomes
- Adjust models based on forecast errors
- Consider external factors in long-term forecasts
- Maintain multiple scenario forecasts

### Business Application
- Align trend analysis with business planning cycles
- Translate technical trends into business impacts
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Regular stakeholder review and feedback
- Integration with capacity and budget planning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Trend Analysis Issues
- **Poor Forecast Accuracy**: Check for missing seasonal patterns or external factors
- **Trend Model Instability**: Increase historical data depth or adjust smoothing
- **Anomaly False Positives**: Tune detection thresholds or improve baseline models
- **Seasonal Pattern Misidentification**: Use longer historical periods for analysis

### Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate data sampling for large datasets
- Cache computed trend models for faster queries
- Parallel processing for multiple metric analysis
- Incremental updates for real-time trending
