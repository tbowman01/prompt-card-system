## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### Critical Issues: 0
No critical issues found.

### Medium Priority Issues: 2

1. **Tutorial 2 Length Constraints**
   - **Issue**: Realistic responses exceed defined length ranges
   - **Impact**: May cause false assertion failures
   - **Recommendation**: Adjust length thresholds to be more realistic

2. **Security Sanitization**
   - **Issue**: HTML/SQL injection attempts not automatically sanitized
   - **Impact**: Potential security vulnerability
   - **Recommendation**: Add input sanitization before template processing

### Low Priority Issues: 1

1. **API Error Handling**
   - **Issue**: Model unavailable scenario lacks fallback mechanism
   - **Impact**: May cause test failures during model outages
   - **Recommendation**: Add fallback model configuration

## 🎯 Risk Assessment
