# Test Coverage Fix Report

## Issue Identified
The test coverage was showing 0% across all metrics, but this was actually correct behavior. The issue was not with the coverage configuration, but with the fact that:

1. **Only 75 lines out of 11,675 total lines were covered** (0.64%)
2. **Only the database connection file had meaningful coverage** (61.47%)
3. **All other files had 0% coverage** because they weren't being tested

## Root Cause
The coverage reporting was working correctly. The 0% coverage was an accurate reflection of the test suite's limited scope. The tests were primarily focused on:
- Database connection (61.47% coverage)
- Mock Ollama tests
- Some integration tests

## Coverage Statistics
- **Total Lines**: 11,675
- **Covered Lines**: 75
- **Overall Coverage**: 0.64%
- **Files with Coverage**: Only `src/database/connection.ts`

## Configuration Updates Made

### 1. Created Alternative Jest Configurations
- `jest.config.coverage.js` - Using ts-jest for better accuracy
- `jest.config.fix.js` - Using SWC with fixed paths

### 2. Updated Jest Configuration
- Added `coveragePathIgnorePatterns` to exclude non-source directories
- Set `coverageProvider: 'v8'` for better accuracy with SWC
- Fixed `collectCoverageFrom` patterns

### 3. Added NPM Scripts
- `test:coverage:fix` - Run tests with explicit coverage patterns

## Next Steps to Improve Coverage

1. **Write More Unit Tests**
   - Focus on service layer (currently 0% coverage)
   - Add middleware tests
   - Test route handlers

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Fix failing Docker integration tests
   - Add more end-to-end scenarios

3. **Coverage Thresholds**
   - Consider lowering thresholds temporarily while building test suite
   - Set incremental goals (e.g., 20% → 40% → 60% → 80%)

## Verification
Run the following command to see current coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

The coverage report is now accurate and shows the true state of test coverage in the project.
