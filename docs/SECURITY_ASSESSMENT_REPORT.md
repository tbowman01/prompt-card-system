## 8. Critical Security Findings

### 8.1 High Priority Issues
1. **JWT Secret Management**: Secrets are configured via environment variables but need rotation mechanism
2. **Missing MFA**: No multi-factor authentication implementation
3. **No API Key Management**: For service-to-service authentication

### 8.2 Medium Priority Issues
1. **Password Policy**: No enforced complexity requirements
2. **Session Timeout**: No absolute session timeout
3. **Audit Log Retention**: 30-day retention may be insufficient for compliance

### 8.3 Low Priority Issues
1. **CSP Enhancements**: Could be more restrictive
2. **Security Training**: No evidence of security awareness logs
3. **Penetration Testing**: No automated security testing

## 9. Security Metrics Summary
