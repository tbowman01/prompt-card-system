# Security Best Practices

## üîí Overview

This document outlines security best practices for the Prompt Card System project. Following these guidelines helps maintain a secure development environment and protects against common security vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Development Security

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Run security linters and static analysis tools
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Code Review**: All code changes require security-focused reviews
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent injection attacks

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Strong Authentication**: Use multi-factor authentication for all accounts
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling
- **Token Security**: Use secure token generation and validation
- **API Security**: Implement proper API authentication and rate limiting

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Data Retention**: Implement proper data retention policies
- **Backup Security**: Secure backup data with encryption
- **Privacy Controls**: Implement privacy-by-design principles

## üîß Infrastructure Security

### Container Security
- **Base Images**: Use minimal, security-hardened base images
- **Image Scanning**: Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- **Runtime Security**: Implement container runtime security controls
- **Network Policies**: Use network segmentation and policies
- **Secrets Management**: Never embed secrets in container images

### CI/CD Security
- **Pipeline Security**: Secure CI/CD pipelines with proper access controls
- **Artifact Security**: Sign and verify build artifacts
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate development, staging, and production
- **Audit Logging**: Log all CI/CD activities for audit trails
- **Approval Processes**: Implement approval gates for production deployments

### Cloud Security
- **Access Management**: Use cloud IAM best practices
- **Network Security**: Implement proper network controls
- **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and alerting
- **Compliance**: Follow cloud security compliance frameworks
- **Incident Response**: Have cloud-specific incident response procedures

## üö® Incident Response

### Immediate Response
1. **Identify**: Detect and analyze security incidents
2. **Contain**: Limit the scope and impact
3. **Eradicate**: Remove the threat from the environment
4. **Recover**: Restore normal operations
5. **Learn**: Conduct post-incident review

### Communication
