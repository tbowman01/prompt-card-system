## üéØ What is the Prompt Card System?

The Prompt Card System is an enterprise-grade platform designed for systematic LLM testing and development. It provides a comprehensive environment for:

- **Prompt Development**: Create and refine prompts with variable substitution
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write test cases before implementing prompts
- **Multi-Model Testing**: Test across different LLM providers
- **Performance Analytics**: Track and analyze prompt performance
- **Cost Optimization**: Monitor and optimize LLM usage costs
- **Security Validation**: Ensure prompt safety and compliance
- **Team Collaboration**: Real-time collaborative development
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Dependency Management**: Security and compliance monitoring

## üöÄ Core Concepts

### Prompt Cards
Prompt cards are templates that define your prompts with variable placeholders. They serve as the foundation for systematic testing and development.

### Test Cases
Test cases define specific scenarios with input values and expected outcomes. They validate that your prompts work correctly across different situations.

### Assertions
Assertions are validation rules that check if the LLM output meets your criteria. The system supports multiple assertion types including semantic similarity, regex matching, and custom validations.

### Executions
Executions are test runs that generate actual LLM responses and validate them against your assertions. The system supports both single and batch executions.
