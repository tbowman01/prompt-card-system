## 🚀 Development Workflows

### 1. Test-Driven Prompt Development (TDPD)

**Philosophy**: Write tests first, then create prompts to satisfy them.

#### Process Flow
```
1. Define Requirements → 2. Write Test Cases → 3. Create Prompt → 
4. Run Tests → 5. Refine Prompt → 6. Deploy
```

#### Step-by-Step Workflow
```
Week 1: Requirements Analysis
□ Gather business requirements
□ Define success criteria
□ Identify input/output formats
□ Document edge cases

Week 2: Test Case Creation
□ Write happy path test cases
□ Create edge case tests
□ Add error handling tests
□ Define performance benchmarks

Week 3: Prompt Development
□ Create initial prompt template
□ Define variables and constraints
□ Run initial tests
□ Iterate based on results

Week 4: Optimization & Deployment
□ Optimize for performance
□ Conduct A/B testing
□ Document final version
□ Deploy to production
```

#### Example: Customer Support Prompt
```
Requirements: Generate empathetic customer support responses
Test Cases (Week 2):
- Billing inquiry → Must acknowledge issue and provide steps
- Technical problem → Must offer troubleshooting steps
- Angry customer → Must de-escalate and show empathy

Prompt Development (Week 3):
Initial: Basic response template
Iteration 1: Add empathy statements
Iteration 2: Include troubleshooting steps
Final: Optimized for all test cases
```

### 2. Agile Prompt Development

```

#### Workflow Steps
```
1. CRM Event Trigger (new lead, support ticket, etc.)
2. Webhook sends data to Prompt Card System
3. Appropriate prompt selected based on event type
4. LLM generates personalized response/analysis
5. Results sent back to CRM
6. CRM updates records and notifies user
```

#### Example: Lead Scoring
```javascript
// Webhook handler
app.post('/webhook/lead-created', async (req, res) => {
  const lead = req.body;
  
  // Generate lead analysis
  const analysis = await promptCard.execute('lead-scoring', {
    company: lead.company,
    industry: lead.industry,
    size: lead.employeeCount,
    budget: lead.budget,
    timeline: lead.timeline
  });
  
  // Update CRM with insights
  await crm.updateLead(lead.id, {
    aiScore: analysis.score,
    insights: analysis.insights,
    nextActions: analysis.recommendations
  });
});
```

```

#### Testing Framework
```
Hypothesis Example:
"Adding specific examples to our customer service prompt will improve response relevance by 15%"

Test Design:
- Control: Current prompt
- Variant A: Prompt with 2 examples
- Variant B: Prompt with 4 examples
- Success Metric: Relevance score (1-5 scale)
- Sample Size: 1000 requests per variant
- Duration: 2 weeks
```

#### Statistical Analysis
```javascript
// A/B Test Results Analysis
const testResults = {
  control: { relevanceScore: 3.2, n: 1000 },
  variantA: { relevanceScore: 3.6, n: 1000 },
  variantB: { relevanceScore: 3.7, n: 1000 }
};

// Statistical significance testing
const significance = calculateSignificance(testResults);
if (significance.pValue < 0.05) {
  console.log(`Statistically significant improvement: ${significance.winner}`);
  deployWinningVariant(significance.winner);
}
```
