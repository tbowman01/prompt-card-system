● 🎯 Recommended Next Improvements

  1. 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance (High Priority)

  - Integration tests for Docker environment: Create tests that verify all services start correctly and communicate properly
  - E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress: Test critical user workflows in the containerized environment
  - Performance benchmarks: Establish baseline metrics for response times and throughput
  - Load testing: Use Artillery or k6 to test system under load

  2. 🔒 Security Enhancements (High Priority)

  - API rate limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Authentication/Authorization: Add proper user authentication (JWT already configured but not implemented)
  - Input validation: Strengthen validation on all API endpoints
  - Security headers: Add helmet.js for security headers
  - API key management: For LLM service access control

  3. 📊 Observability & Monitoring (Medium-High Priority)

  - Structured logging: Implement proper logging with correlation IDs
  - OpenTelemetry integration: Add distributed tracing
  - Error tracking: Integrate Sentry or similar for error monitoring
  - Custom metrics: Track business metrics (prompt usage, model performance)
  - Alerting: Set up alerts for critical issues

  4. 🚀 Production Readiness (Medium Priority)

  - Production Docker configs: Create optimized production Dockerfiles
  - CI/CD pipeline: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
  - Database migrations: Implement proper migration system
  - Backup automation: Scheduled backups for database and user data
  - Graceful shutdown: Ensure services shutdown cleanly

  5. ✨ Feature Enhancements (Medium Priority)

  - Batch processing API: Process multiple prompts efficiently
  - Webhook support: Notify external systems of test results
  - Export improvements: Add more export formats (JSON, YAML)
  - Template library: Pre-built prompt templates
  - Version control: Track prompt card versions

  6. 🎨 Developer Experience (Low-Medium Priority)

  - API documentation: Generate OpenAPI/Swagger docs
  - Development seeds: Sample data for new developers
  - Git hooks: Pre-commit hooks for linting and testing
  - VS Code debugging: Launch configurations for debugging
  - Development proxy: Handle CORS in development

  7. 🔧 Infrastructure (Low Priority)

  - Kubernetes manifests: For cloud deployment
  - Terraform/Pulumi: Infrastructure as code
  - CDN integration: For static assets
  - Queue system: Bull/BullMQ for background jobs
  - Caching strategy: Implement proper cache invalidation

  📋 Quick Win Suggestions (Start Here!)

  1. Add health checks to all services (backend partially done, need frontend/Redis)
  2. Create Docker integration tests to ensure environment stability
  3. Implement basic rate limiting on API endpoints
  4. Add structured logging with winston or pino
  5. Document the Docker setup in README.md
