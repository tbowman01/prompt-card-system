const mockTechResponse = `Hi Mike,

I understand how frustrating it must be when the software crashes during report exports. Let me help you troubleshoot this issue step by step.

First, please try these troubleshooting steps:
1. Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. Try exporting a smaller report to test if it's a data volume issue
3. Check if the problem occurs with different report formats

If the crashes continue, please follow these additional steps:
- Update to the latest version of the software
- Try using a different browser
- Contact our technical team with the specific error message

I'll also escalate this to our development team to investigate potential solutions for the export functionality.

Please let me know if these steps resolve the issue or if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
Technical Support Team`;

I sincerely apologize for the frustration you've experienced and for the fact that this is your third attempt to get this issue resolved. I completely understand how disappointing and frustrating this must be for you.

Your concern is absolutely valid, and I want to ensure we resolve this properly this time. I'm immediately escalating your case to our senior support manager who will personally oversee the resolution process.

Here's what I'm doing right now:
1. Escalating to Senior Manager Sarah Johnson (she'll contact you within 2 hours)
2. Creating a priority case file with full history of your previous contacts
3. Ensuring this receives urgent attention until fully resolved

You should receive a call from Sarah Johnson before end of business today. She has the authority to resolve this issue and will ensure you receive the service level you deserve.

Thank you for your patience, and I apologize again for the inconvenience.

Sincerely,
Robert Chen
Senior Customer Service Representative`;
